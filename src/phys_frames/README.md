# PhysFrame


PHYSFRAME is a static analysis tool for detecting reference frame inconsistencies and violations of common practices (i.e., implicit frame conventions) in C/C++ projects that build against the [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/). It requires nothing from the developers running the tool on their project. The tool automatically models the project, and checks for problems.
