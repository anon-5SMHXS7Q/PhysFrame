STEP ONE:
INSTALL CppCheck 1.80 in the root directory of the artifact repository:

1. Download CppCheck 1.80 version source code zip from https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/tree/1.80
2. Extract source code to the root directory of the artifact repository. You should see 'cppcheck-1.80' directory.
3. From the command line, build the source code:
       cd cppcheck-1.80
       make SRCDIR=build CFGDIR=cfg HAVE_RULES=no CXXFLAGS="-O2 -DNDEBUG -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-function"

You should see 'cppcheck' binary in the 'cppcheck-1.80' directory.


STEP TWO:
Install Docker. The Dockerfile for physframe has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04.

From the command line, build physframe with docker:

       docker build . -t physframe


TEST THE INSTALLATION:
From the command line, run physframe docker image:

       docker run -v "$(pwd)"/data/gps_umd:/gps_umd physframe /gps_umd

You should see the output of physframe, including:
